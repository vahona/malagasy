# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Instead of duplicating styles think about how to combine them
2. The individual components should contain more than just a container. If we don't do that, what is the point of having components? Our goal is abstraction and decluttering the higher scopes.
3. Pass onPress as a prop.
4. (minor) fix your prettier setup, there are many empty lines in the code.
5. remove unused code, imports and logs

## Components

- Next button 5/5
- Action button 3/5
- Tool buttons 4/5
- Language Switcher 3/5
- Section Heading 1/5 I can't give you many points because you built the wrong component, the section heading is the text on top of the lists, not the app title (If this misunderstanding was due to our instructions, please tell me)
- List item 3/5
- List 3/5
- Textarea 4/5 // longer text not centered, font size of editable to small
- U1 9/10 // Home screen looks good
- U8 0/10 
- U9 0/10 
- Github workflow 8/10 Description of PR should be longer and have clickup link.
- No spelling mistakes: 5/5
- Clickup workflow: 3/3 
- Use of screen navigation 0/5
- React Context: 0/5
- Reducer 0/5
- Clean Code: 5/10 // See general issues, apart from that I really like your structure and style

Total 56/123 => 46%   

The component-children issue really weighed you down. I'd like to talk with you about the correct use of components, so that that part of your projects can be as good as the rest, which I found to be clean and understandable. 
 If there is something left unclear, ask, even in a graded project. It will always be worth it. Ask, ask, ask questions, I promise everything under <100 questions a day will not annoy anybody. I hope this feedback will be helpful for you!
